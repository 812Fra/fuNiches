Description: Provides a modular and reproducible workflow to quantify, 
    compare, and visualize the ecological niches of species. It integrates 
    robust functionalities for variable selection (Boruta), niche modeling 
    (hypervolume), and multivariate community analysis (vegan) into a 
    streamlined pipeline.
